  # `Util.Montgomery` — Montgomery-form algebraic bridges

  Pure `Int`-arithmetic helpers anchoring the Montgomery-reduction
  family of Triples (L0.3, L0.4, L2.x, L6.x).

  This is **the L0.3 keystone module**. It contains the integer-level
  "given that `(value + k·q) % R = 0`, the Montgomery identity
  holds" lemma referenced from
  Tier 1. Closing this file unblocks `montgomery_reduce_element_spec`
  and (transitively) every downstream Triple that reasons about
  values in the Montgomery domain.

  Conventions: `q = 3329`, `R = 2^16`. The lemmas are stated on
  `Int` (not `Nat`), since signed Montgomery reduction in libcrux-iot
  ML-KEM operates on `Std.I32` values whose `.val : Int` can be
  negative.

  The downstream user uses `mont_reduce_int_form` immediately after
  reducing the impl Triple to an `Int`-level chain via the BV-to-Int
  bridge for `IScalar.cast`, `wrapping_mul`, and `>>>` (arithmetic
  shift right).

/-- **`mont_reduce_int_form`** — the L0.3 algebraic keystone.

    Given that `value + k · q` is divisible by `R = 2^16` (as an
    integer), the Montgomery quotient `(value + k · q) / R` satisfies
    `quotient · R ≡ value (mod q)`.

    This is the integer-arithmetic content of the signed-Montgomery-
    reduction correctness argument. The `+` (vs `-`) here matches the
    impl's two's-complement choice of `k`: the impl computes `k` so
    that `value + k · q` cancels in the low 16 bits (the
    `(62209 · 3329) % 2^16 = 1` keystone makes the choice
    `k := value · 62209 (mod 2^16)` give that cancellation, with the
    sign absorbed into the wrap-around).

/-- **`sub_div_of_emod_eq_zero`** — auxiliary used by L0.3.

    When `(a - b) % R = 0` (i.e. `a ≡ b (mod R)`), the difference of
    floored quotients `a / R - b / R` equals the exact quotient
    `(a - b) / R`. This is what bridges the impl's two separate
    arithmetic-shift-right operations (`value >> 16` and
    `(k · q) >> 16`) to the single mathematical quotient
    `(value - k · q) / 2^16` that the keystone uses.

    Used by `montgomery_reduce_element_spec` (L0.3) immediately after
    the BV-level reduction places the goal in `Int` form. -/

/-- **Bridge: old → new Montgomery modq form.**

    Given the old-form modular equation `r * 2^16 ≡ v (mod 3329)`,
    derive the new-form `r ≡ v * 169 (mod 3329)` via the
    `mont_R_inv_q` keystone `(2^16 * 169) % 3329 = 1`.

    The keystone implies `r * (2^16 * 169) ≡ r (mod 3329)`, hence
    multiplying both sides of the old form by 169 yields the new form.

    Used by L0.4 `montgomery_multiply_fe_by_fer_spec` and any
    downstream Triple that needs to convert from the
    `r·R ≡ v (mod q)` shape (impl-native) to the
    `r ≡ v·R⁻¹ (mod q)` shape (F*-native, with `R⁻¹ = 169`). -/
